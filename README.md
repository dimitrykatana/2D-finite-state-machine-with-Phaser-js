# 2D finite state machine in js

# To run the game you just need to go into the index.html and open it on a server.
Works perfectly fine with the live server extension on vs code


This was a personal project where i wanted to code a finite state machine in 2D using a character spritesheet.
The character can jump, move left or right and attack. It acts differently if he is in the air or on the ground.
